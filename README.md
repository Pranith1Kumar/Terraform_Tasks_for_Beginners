#### *Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice where IT infrastructure—such as virtual machines, networks, load balancers, and databases—is managed and provisioned through code instead of manual processes.*

#### IaC allows DevOps engineers to:

* Define infrastructure in declarative or imperative code
* Deploy infrastructure consistently without manual steps
* Version-control infra changes just like application code
* Automate provisioning, scaling, and configuration

#### Benefits of IaC

* Faster deployments
* Reduced manual effort
* Lower operational cost
* Lower risk & fewer misconfigurations
* Highly repeatable & reliable infra setup
* Easy rollback using Git

#### Why IaC Matters

* Managing infrastructure manually leads to:
* Errors and inconsistent configurations
* Slow deployments
* High maintenance overhead
* Difficulty scaling and version-controlling changes
* IaC solves this by turning infrastructure into automated, repeatable code.

### Terraform with IaC

#### Terraform automates the way infrastructure is defined and deployed across cloud environments. It supports a wide range of public cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and OCI.

### *Terraform Core Tool for IaC*

Terraform is one of the most widely used IaC tools. It enables you to:

* Write infrastructure definitions using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
* Deploy cloud resources across providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
* Plan changes before applying using terraform plan
* Manage infra state using terraform.tfstate
* Ensure predictable deployments using modules and workspaces.

## *Terraform – Recommended Certifications*

### 1. **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate**

<a href="https://www.pulumi.com/"><img src="https://www.pulumi.com/logos/brand/logo-on-black.svg"></img></a>


### *Why Pulumi?*

* Use familiar programming languages instead of DSLs
* Supports multi-cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, DigitalOcean, and more
* Enables loops, conditionals, functions, and classes for advanced infra logic
* Integration with CI/CD pipelines is straightforward
* State can be stored in Pulumi Cloud, S3, Azure Blob, GCS, etc.

Pulumi Registry: large ecosystem of official providers and reusable infrastructure templates
### [↗ Click to explore more Pulumi Registry](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/)

#### *Pulumi* supports a wide range of cloud providers—just like Terraform—and these providers are available through the Pulumi Registry. The Pulumi Registry is a large ecosystem that offers official cloud providers along with reusable infrastructure templates and components. It helps developers quickly integrate services, follow best practices, and build consistent, production-ready infrastructure using real programming languages.

### *Pulumi Core Features*

* Infrastructure defined using general-purpose languages
* Real code reusability (functions, modules, packages)
* Rich ecosystem of cloud providers via Pulumi Registry
* Great for teams already using TypeScript/Python/Golang
* Pulumi is ideal when you want IaC + full programming flexibility.


### *Pulumi – Recommended Certifications*

### **Pulumi does not currently offer official exams, but recognized training programs exist.**

 ###  1. Pulumi Cloud Engineering Certification (Unofficial, Pulumi University Track)

### Ansible with IaC

Ansible is an automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and provisioning using a simple YAML-based language.

### *Why Ansible?*

* Uses human-readable YAML playbooks
* Agentless—requires only SSH or WinRM
* Great for configuring servers, installing packages, managing users
* Works with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) via Ansible modules
* Ideal for post-provisioning setup after Terraform/Pulumi create resources

### *Ansible Core Features*

* Automates configuration and software setup
* Ensures servers stay consistent with desired configuration
* Uses roles, tasks, and inventories
* Easy to integrate with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI
* Ansible is perfect for server configuration + orchestration, often used alongside Terraform or Pulumi.
