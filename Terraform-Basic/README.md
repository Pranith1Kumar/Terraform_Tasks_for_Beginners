### Terraform Core Tool for IaC

Terraform is one of the most widely used IaC tools. It enables you to:

* Write infrastructure definitions using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
* Deploy cloud resources across providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
* Plan changes before applying using terraform plan
* Manage infra state using terraform.tfstate
* Ensure predictable deployments using modules and workspaces.

### Terraform Workflow

* Write Terraform Configuration – Begin defining your infrastructure using HCL.
* Plan Infrastructure – Review and validate the proposed changes before deployment.
* Deploy Infrastructure – Apply the changes to provision or update the infrastructure.

### Terraform Registry
#### The Terraform Registry is an official catalog where you can find verified providers and reusable modules. It enables you to easily integrate cloud services, reuse community modules, and simplify infrastructure automation.

#### With Terraform, you can reuse the same code to deploy consistent environments across multiple clouds. It also manages state files to track the current status of every resource, ensuring accurate and reliable infrastructure management.
